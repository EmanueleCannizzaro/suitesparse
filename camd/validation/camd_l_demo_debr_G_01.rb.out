CAMD demo:

camd version 2.3, Jun 20, 2012:  approximate minimum degree ordering:
    dense row parameter: 10
    (rows with more than max (10 * sqrt (n), 16) entries are
    considered "dense", and placed last in output permutation)
    aggressive absorption:  yes


Input matrix:  8-by-8, with 13 entries.
   Note that for a symmetric matrix such as this one, only the
   strictly lower or upper triangular parts would need to be
   passed to CAMD, since CAMD computes the ordering of A+A'.  The
   diagonal entries are also not needed, since CAMD ignores them.

Column: 0, number of entries: 2, with row indices in Ai [0 ... 1]:
    row indices: 1 4

Column: 1, number of entries: 3, with row indices in Ai [2 ... 4]:
    row indices: 2 3 4

Column: 2, number of entries: 2, with row indices in Ai [5 ... 6]:
    row indices: 4 5

Column: 3, number of entries: 3, with row indices in Ai [7 ... 9]:
    row indices: 5 6 7

Column: 4, number of entries: 1, with row indices in Ai [10 ... 10]:
    row indices: 6

Column: 5, number of entries: 1, with row indices in Ai [11 ... 11]:
    row indices: 6

Column: 6, number of entries: 1, with row indices in Ai [12 ... 12]:
    row indices: 7

Column: 7, number of entries: 0, with row indices in Ai [13 ... 12]:

return value from camd_order: 0 (should be 0)

    status: OK
    n, dimension of A:                                  8
    nz, number of nonzeros in A:                        13
    symmetry of A:                                      0.0000
    number of nonzeros on diagonal:                     0
    nonzeros in pattern of A+A' (excl. diagonal):       26
    # dense rows/columns of A+A':                       0
    memory used, in bytes:                              952
    # of memory compactions:                            0

    The following approximate statistics are for a subsequent
    factorization of A(P,P) + A(P,P)'.  They are slight upper
    bounds if there are no dense rows/columns in A+A', and become
    looser if dense rows/columns exist.

    nonzeros in L (excluding diagonal):                 16
    nonzeros in L (including diagonal):                 24
    # divide operations for LDL' or LU:                 16
    # multiply-subtract operations for LDL':            28
    # multiply-subtract operations for LU:              40
    max nz. in any column of L (incl. diagonal):        4

    chol flop count for real A, sqrt counted as 1 flop: 80
    LDL' flop count for real A:                         72
    LDL' flop count for complex A:                      368
    LU flop count for real A (with no pivoting):        96
    LU flop count for complex A (with no pivoting):     464

Permutation vector:
  0  4  2  7  1  3  6  5

Inverse permutation vector:
  0  4  2  5  1  7  6  3

Execution of CAMD demo: OK
