CAMD demo:

camd version 2.3, Jun 20, 2012:  approximate minimum degree ordering:
    dense row parameter: 10
    (rows with more than max (10 * sqrt (n), 16) entries are
    considered "dense", and placed last in output permutation)
    aggressive absorption:  yes


Input matrix:  62-by-62, with 159 entries.
   Note that for a symmetric matrix such as this one, only the
   strictly lower or upper triangular parts would need to be
   passed to CAMD, since CAMD computes the ordering of A+A'.  The
   diagonal entries are also not needed, since CAMD ignores them.
