CAMD demo:

camd version 2.3, Jun 20, 2012:  approximate minimum degree ordering:
    dense row parameter: 10
    (rows with more than max (10 * sqrt (n), 16) entries are
    considered "dense", and placed last in output permutation)
    aggressive absorption:  yes


Input matrix:  19-by-19, with 38 entries.
   Note that for a symmetric matrix such as this one, only the
   strictly lower or upper triangular parts would need to be
   passed to CAMD, since CAMD computes the ordering of A+A'.  The
   diagonal entries are also not needed, since CAMD ignores them.

    The following approximate statistics are for a subsequent
    factorization of A(P,P) + A(P,P)'.  They are slight upper
    bounds if there are no dense rows/columns in A+A', and become
    looser if dense rows/columns exist.

    nonzeros in L (excluding diagonal):                 89
    nonzeros in L (including diagonal):                 108
