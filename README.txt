===========

SuiteSparse: A Suite of Sparse matrix packages authored or co-authored by Tim Davis (http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/). 
It consists of:

    SuiteSparseQR multithreaded multifrontal sparse QR factorization
    AMD: approximate minimum degree
    CAMD: constrainted approximate minimum degree
    CCOLAMD: constrained column approximate minimum degree
    COLAMD: column approximate minimum degree
    CHOLMOD: sparse supernodal Cholesky factorization and update/downdate
    LDL: a simple LDL^T factorization
    UMFPACK: sparse multifrontal LU factorization
    SuiteSparse_config : common configurations for SuiteSparse (for all but CSparse)
    CSparse,: a concise sparse matrix package a sparse matrix package for my book, Direct Methods for Sparse Linear Systems, published as part of SIAM's book series on the Fundamentals of Algorithms
    CXSparse: CSparse eXtended, with support for complex matrices,
    RBio: read/write matrices in Rutherford/Boeing format
    BTF: permutation to block triangular form
    KLU: sparse LU factorization, for circuit simulation
