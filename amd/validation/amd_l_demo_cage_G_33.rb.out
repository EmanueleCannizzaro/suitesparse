AMD demo:

Approximate minimum degree ordering
    dense row parameter: 10
    (rows with more than max (10 * sqrt (n), 16) entries are
    considered "dense", and placed last in output permutation)
    aggressive absorption:  yes

Input matrix:  76-by-76, with 152 entries.
   Note that for a symmetric matrix such as this one, only the
   strictly lower or upper triangular parts would need to be
   passed to AMD, since AMD computes the ordering of A+A'.  The
   diagonal entries are also not needed, since AMD ignores them.
