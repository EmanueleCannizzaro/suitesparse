AMD demo:

Approximate minimum degree ordering
    dense row parameter: 10
    (rows with more than max (10 * sqrt (n), 16) entries are
    considered "dense", and placed last in output permutation)
    aggressive absorption:  yes

Input matrix:  14-by-14, with 21 entries.
   Note that for a symmetric matrix such as this one, only the
   strictly lower or upper triangular parts would need to be
   passed to AMD, since AMD computes the ordering of A+A'.  The
   diagonal entries are also not needed, since AMD ignores them.

    n, dimension of A:                                  14
    nz, number of nonzeros in A:                        21
    symmetry of A:                                      0.0000
    number of nonzeros on diagonal:                     0
    nonzeros in pattern of A+A' (excl. diagonal):       42
    # dense rows/columns of A+A':                       0
    memory used, in bytes:                              1408
    # of memory compactions:                            0

    The following approximate statistics are for a subsequent
    factorization of A(P,P) + A(P,P)'.  They are slight upper
    bounds if there are no dense rows/columns in A+A', and become
    looser if dense rows/columns exist.

    nonzeros in L (excluding diagonal):                 42
    nonzeros in L (including diagonal):                 56
    # divide operations for LDL' or LU:                 42
    # multiply-subtract operations for LDL':            98
    # multiply-subtract operations for LU:              154
    max nz. in any column of L (incl. diagonal):        7

    chol flop count for real A, sqrt counted as 1 flop: 252
    LDL' flop count for real A:                         238
