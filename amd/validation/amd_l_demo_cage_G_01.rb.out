AMD demo:

Approximate minimum degree ordering
    dense row parameter: 10
    (rows with more than max (10 * sqrt (n), 16) entries are
    considered "dense", and placed last in output permutation)
    aggressive absorption:  yes

Input matrix:  10-by-10, with 15 entries.
   Note that for a symmetric matrix such as this one, only the
   strictly lower or upper triangular parts would need to be
   passed to AMD, since AMD computes the ordering of A+A'.  The
   diagonal entries are also not needed, since AMD ignores them.

Column: 3, number of entries: 2, with row indices in Ai [7 ... 8]:
    row indices: 8 9

Column: 4, number of entries: 2, with row indices in Ai [9 ... 10]:

    row indices: 7 9

Column: 6, number of entries: 1, with row indices in Ai [13 ... 13]:
    row indices: 9

Column: 7, number of entries: 1, with row indices in Ai [14 ... 14]:

return value from amd_order: 0 (should be 0)

    n, dimension of A:                                  10
    nz, number of nonzeros in A:                        15
    symmetry of A:                                      0.0000
    number of nonzeros on diagonal:                     0
    nonzeros in pattern of A+A' (excl. diagonal):       30
    # dense rows/columns of A+A':                       0
    memory used, in bytes:                              1008
    # of memory compactions:                            0

    The following approximate statistics are for a subsequent
    factorization of A(P,P) + A(P,P)'.  They are slight upper
    bounds if there are no dense rows/columns in A+A', and become
    looser if dense rows/columns exist.

    nonzeros in L (excluding diagonal):                 27
    nonzeros in L (including diagonal):                 37
    # divide operations for LDL' or LU:                 27
    # multiply-subtract operations for LDL':            59
    # multiply-subtract operations for LU:              91
    max nz. in any column of L (incl. diagonal):        6

    chol flop count for real A, sqrt counted as 1 flop: 155
    LDL' flop count for real A:                         145
    LDL' flop count for complex A:                      715
