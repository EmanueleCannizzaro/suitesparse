AMD demo:

Approximate minimum degree ordering
    dense row parameter: 10
    (rows with more than max (10 * sqrt (n), 16) entries are
    considered "dense", and placed last in output permutation)
    aggressive absorption:  yes

Input matrix:  58-by-58, with 87 entries.
   Note that for a symmetric matrix such as this one, only the
   strictly lower or upper triangular parts would need to be
   passed to AMD, since AMD computes the ordering of A+A'.  The
   diagonal entries are also not needed, since AMD ignores them.

    bounds if there are no dense rows/columns in A+A', and become
    looser if dense rows/columns exist.
